**Reporter:**
Who is reporting this? Zayne - Zayne#5545

**Summary:**
This is an issue that is something that has occured to more than just myself. The premises is that when items are taken from the original storage, they are sometimes replicated to be an error, where the item becomes a missing locale. Not sure of the exact cause.
